# Auto Correct Model

In our case, the autocorrection system needs to be **word-based and efficient** because the text is generated letter by letter from EEG signals. A word-level correction avoids the complexity of context-dependent models and provides fast, lightweight corrections that can run in real time. Since the system is meant to support individuals with severe disabilities, efficiency is crucialâ€”delays or heavy models would make communication slow and impractical. Therefore, choosing a correction approach that balances **accuracy with real-time performance** is essential:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

## Comparison of Commonly Used Models

| Library        | Efficiency (Speed) | Accuracy (Word-Level) | Notes                                                                 |
|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| autocorrect    | 7/10               | 6/10                   | Very lightweight, quick setup, good for simple corrections.          |
| pyspellchecker | 8/10               | 7/10                   | Pure Python, widely used, balanced between speed and accuracy.       |
| SymSpell       | 10/10              | 8/10                   | Extremely fast & memory-efficient, great for real-time use.          |
| Hunspell       | 6/10               | 9/10                   | Industry-grade, robust with morphology/affixes, but heavier.         |
| JamSpell       | 8/10               | 8/10                   | Statistical model, accurate at sentence-level, efficient enough.     |
